    "1.   Crew in crewAI represents a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Each crew defines the strategy for task execution, agent collaboration, and the overall workflow.\n",
    "2.   Agents is an autonomous unit that can perform specific tasks, Make decisions based on its role and goal, Communicate and collaborate with other agents, Maintain memory of interactions, and Delegate tasks when required.\n",
    "3.   Tasks is a specific assignment completed by an Agent.\n",
    "4.   LLM or Large Language Models (LLMs) are the core intelligence behind CrewAI agents.\n",
    "5.   Tools in CrewAI is a skill or function that agents can utilize to perform various actions. This includes tools from the CrewAI Toolkit and LangChain Tools, enabling everything from simple searches to complex interactions and effective teamwork among agents.\n"
